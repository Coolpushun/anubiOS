<h2>:clipboard: About us</h2>
  <p>
    anubiOS is a new, <strong>revolutionary, and modern operating system (OS)</strong> that has been built from the ground up, with absolutely 
    <strong>zero DNA from other distributions</strong>. Its entire philosophy centers on 
    <strong>Easy use as Human Language</strong>, making it intuitive and accessible for everyone.
  </p>

  <p>
    anubiOS introduces fundamental changes, including its own suite of custom-built applications and truly 
    <strong>unique features</strong> that are simply unavailable in other distributions. At the core of this system is the custom-built 
    <strong>Anuapp package manager</strong>, designed from scratch to handle both GUI and CLI installations seamlessly from its own source tree.
  </p>

  <p>
    We are currently developing two versions of anubiOS. However, at the official 
    <strong>anubiOS Opening Event during the IT Festival in the Netherlands</strong>, we will unveil one truly unique, special edition versionâ€”a 
    <strong>limited release</strong> that embodies the full vision of this project.

The initial release leverages a <strong>highly secured and minimal base</strong> to guarantee functionality, while all <strong>anubiOS</strong> applications, the **Anuapp** package manager, and the **anubi AI** are built and configured by our team.
