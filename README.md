  <!-- About OS-->
<h2>:clipboard: About OS</h2>
  <p>
    anubiOS is a new, <strong>revolutionary, and modern operating system (OS)</strong> that has been built from the ground up, with absolutely 
    <strong>zero DNA from other distributions</strong>. Its entire philosophy centers on 
    <strong>Easy use as Human Language</strong>, making it intuitive and accessible for everyone.
  </p>

  <p>
    anubiOS introduces fundamental changes, including its own suite of custom-built applications and truly 
    <strong>unique features</strong> that are simply unavailable in other distributions. At the core of this system is the custom-built 
    <strong>Anuapp package manager</strong>, designed from scratch to handle both GUI and CLI installations seamlessly from its own source tree.
  </p>

  <p>
    We are currently developing two versions of anubiOS. However, at the official 
    <strong>anubiOS Opening Event during the IT Festival in the Netherlands</strong>, we will unveil one truly unique, special edition version—a 
    <strong>limited release</strong> that embodies the full vision of this project.

  <!-- Introduction tio Features -->
  
  <h2>:paperclip: Introduction of Features</h2>
  
  <p><strong>Zero DNA</strong></p>
  <p><strong>anubiOS</strong> is a truly <strong>independent </strong>operating system, engineered from the ground up with <strong>Zero DNA</strong> from established distributions like Ubuntu, Arch, or Debian. It features its own custom package manager, <strong>Anuapp</strong>, built entirely from scratch to manage its source tree.</p>
  
  &nbsp;
  
  <p><strong>United package manager (Anuapp)</strong></p>
  <p>Anuapp is our custom-built, unified package manager that eliminates the complexity of traditional system tools. Designed from scratch, it handles all applications and packages—including those for the anubiOS source tree, Linux, Flathub, Windows, and Android—all from one single, intuitive system.</p>
  <p>It doesn't just manage packages; it simplifies the process to reflect our "Easy use as Human Language" philosophy.</p>
  &nbsp;
  <p><strong>From this:</strong></p>

<code style="background-color: #0088ff; color: #fff; padding: 5px 10px; border-radius: 5px; font-size: 1.1em;">sudo pacman -S firefox / sudo apt install firefox</code>

  <p><strong>Into this:</strong></p>
  
<code style="background-color: #0088ff; color: #fff; padding: 5px 10px; border-radius: 5px; font-size: 1.1em;">anuapp install firefox</code>
  
  &nbsp;

<p><strong>Unified Software Store</strong></p>
<p>Say goodbye to complicated repositories and fragmented package sources. The Unified Software Store is the graphical front-end for our custom-built Anuapp package manager. It brings all software installations, updates, and removals into one simple, fast, and beautiful interface. With zero DNA from other distributions, the store connects directly to the anubiOS source tree, guaranteeing speed and security. Searching for a program is as easy as human language; one click is all it takes to get to work.</p>

&nbsp;

<p><strong>Simple Terminal</strong></p>
<p>We believe the command line should not be intimidating. The Simple Terminal for anubiOS is designed for clarity, power, and intuitive interaction. It integrates seamlessly with our custom Anuapp package manager, allowing you to use simple, natural language commands to manage your system, just as effectively as the GUI: </p>
